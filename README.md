# MUN Presenter

Add a level of professionalism to your MUN sessions with this little app I built. It's designed to help conferences look more professional and help chairs keep track of who has and hasn't spoken. With MUN Presenter, the chairs can have a professionally designed screen facing the audience that includes a timer, speakers list logo, conference name, resolution information, and much more.

## Features
- Customize logos and colors to make your MUN look that much more professional
- Built in speaker tracking to keep track of who has spoken and how many times
- CSV export of speaker information
- Mac and Windows support
- Multi-screen support
  - As long as your screen is on extended mode, MUN Presenter will show the presentation on the projector which chairs can manipulate from their side
